	"description": "Adds interactions between dispensers and bundles. If a dispenser uses a bundle when facing into a container, it will pull the first stack and try to place it into the bundle. If the dispenser does not face a container, it will empty the bundle contents as item entities. If either of the aforementioned operations fail (e.g. trying to empty an empty bundle, or trying to pull from an empty container), nothing will happen, and the bundle remains in the dispenser. ",
